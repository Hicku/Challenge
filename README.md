# Week One Challenge

## user story 

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Description

The purpose of the project was to make code that is easier to read, does no repeat itself and use search engine optimisation to make the website more visible in search engines. Also, to make the website as accesible to as many people as possible.
I had to read through the code to spot repetitive code and bugs. One problem I faced was to get the 'search engine optimiation' link in the nav bar to function properly. 
This project has helped me to learn how to streamline my code for future projects, and to think from the perspective of other people who may need extra help to gain access to websites. I also learned how important it is to use SEO to make a website more visible online.
